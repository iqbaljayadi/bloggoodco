Grab your visitor's attention and get them to sign up for your email list, or tell them about a specific page they should visit.

== Description ==

**The Attention Grabber is designed to make sure all your visitors know about the things most important to *you*.**

**Grab your visitor's attention and get them to sign up for your email list, or tell them about a specific page they should visit.**

This is a free alternative to [HelloBar](http://www.hellobar.com/), a SaaS which charges based on the number of clicks the bar receives. If your bar receives 7,500 clicks per month, HelloBar would cost you $50/month.

Little bars like these are cropping up all over the Web (e.g., at Neil Patel's [QuickSprout](http://www.quicksprout.com)), and it's no wonder why---they do a fantastic job of getting your visitors to complete your goals for them.

**Features**

Attention Grabber features the ability to:

- Sign up email addresses to your [Customer.io](http://customer.io/ "Customer.io email sending service") account,
- Track the number of signups or clicks you receive using Google Analytics,
- Customize the look and feel of the bar (background color, button color, etc.), and
- Responsively show or hide content to fit comfortable at the top of the user's screen.

== Installation ==


1. Unzip the attention-grabber.zip file into your `wp-content/plugins/` directory. This will give you a new folder there called (creatively) `attention-grabber`.
2. Go to the Plugins page of your Wordpress admin menu (probably located at `your-site-here.com/wp-admin/plugins.php` and click the "Activate" link for "Attention Grabber, by Conversion Insights."
3. Mouse over Settings (in the left-hand side of the Admin screen, near the bottom of the menu) and click the Attention Grabber link.
4. Go to the Primary Stuff tab and set up the tool.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does tracking work? = 

Attention Grabber fires one of two events to Google Analytics when a user interacts with it:

- If they signed up for your email list:
    - Category: emailSignup
    - Action: general
    - Label: Sign up for the general email campaign
- If they clicked the normal (non-email) button:
    - Category: buttonClick
    - Action: Click
    - Label: Clicked the Attention Grabber button with text [primary text of your Attention Grabber]

= Where should I send feature requests & improvements? =

Because this plugin was created to fulfill Conversion Insights' own needs (and we *aren't* a software company!), **we're unable to respond to feature requests**. 

However, if you have improved the Attention Grabber, you're welcome to email us the code and we'll make the improvements available to the world.
